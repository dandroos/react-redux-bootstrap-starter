# React | Redux | Bootstrap Starter
This is a boilerplate to get you up and running quickly, so you can spend less time faffing and more time creating!   
## What's included?
It is a create-react-app install that I have cleaned up (removed React comments and removed unneccesary - *(for me, anyway!)* - features, such as the ServiceWorker.)

It comes with the following NPM packages built-in...

+ [Redux]() ([redux](), [react-redux]() and [redux-thunk]())
+ [Bootstrap]() ([bootstrap](), [reactstrap](), [jquery](), and [popper.js]())
+ [React Spring]() ([react-spring]())

## Cool! Anything else?
Yes, my friend! I have also set up the sass development environment as well*. It imports all of Bootstrap's components separately, so you can comment out the ones you don't need.  Take a look at the app.scss file in the src directory.  Just run `npm start` and it'll automatically watch for changes in that sass file and compile them.

*Please make sure you have [*node-sass*]() installed globally to take advantage of this.

## Great!  What?....more?!
Absolutely!  It also comes with Redux directory/file structure all set up for you.  There is an example action and reducer to get you started in case you are a little rusty or a newcomer!

## Is there a boilerplate without all the starter content?
Yes.  [This way](), mi amigo.

## When should I use this starter?
I would suggest using this for a single page app or a landing page/portfolio site.
